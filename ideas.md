  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalism / Swiss International Style**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Radical Honesty**: Show the "raw materials" of code. No hiding behind glossy abstractions.
  2.  **Structural Integrity**: The layout should feel like a solid grid, unbreakable and robust, mirroring the "scalable" promise.
  3.  **Information Density**: High-contrast, data-rich presentation that respects the intelligence of the founder.
  4.  **Function over Form**: Every element has a purpose; decoration is minimal and strictly functional.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Stark Monochrome**: Dominant black and white to represent binary code and clarity.
  - **Signal Orange (#FF4500)**: Used sparingly for CTAs and critical alerts, representing construction, safety, and urgent action.
  - **Code Blue (#0000FF)**: Pure, unadjusted blue for links and technical accents, referencing default browser styles and blueprints.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette screams "utility" and "engineering." It rejects the soft, friendly SaaS aesthetic in favor of something that looks like a serious tool for serious builders.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Visible grid lines separating sections. Content is boxed and compartmentalized.
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Heavy typography on one side balanced by negative space or technical diagrams on the other.
  - **Split-Screen Hero**: A hard vertical divide in the hero section—problem on the left (chaos), solution on the right (order).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Visible Borders**: Thick, black borders (2px-4px) around buttons, cards, and sections.
  - **Monospace Typography**: Extensive use of monospaced fonts for headers, not just code snippets, to reinforce the "code-first" message.
  - **Raw UI Components**: Buttons that look like default OS controls or terminal inputs, but stylized.
  - **Technical Diagrams**: Instead of abstract illustrations, use schematic-style SVG graphics (flowcharts, ER diagrams).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant Feedback**: Hover states are sharp and immediate (e.g., color inversion), no soft fades.
  - **Mechanical Feel**: Clicks feel tactile.
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor that might look like a terminal caret or crosshair.

  **Animation**:
  - **Step-by-Step Reveal**: Elements appear sequentially like lines of code executing.
  - **Glitch/Typewriter Effects**: Text appearing character by character.
  - **No Easing**: Linear animations or instant state changes to feel robotic and precise.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Space Mono** (Bold, Uppercase).
  - **Body**: **Inter** or **Helvetica Now** (for readability, but kept tight).
  - **Hierarchy**: Size contrast is extreme. Massive headlines vs. small, technical metadata.

  **Design Movement**: **Dark Mode Glassmorphism / "Future Tech"**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Speed & Velocity**: Everything should look fast. Streaks, gradients, and motion.
  2.  **Depth & Layering**: Using transparency and blur to show complexity being managed/contained.
  3.  **Luminescence**: The design should feel like it's glowing from within, powered by AI.
  4.  **Fluidity**: Seamless transitions between sections, representing the smooth scaling of the app.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Void (#050510)**: A rich, almost black background that isn't flat.
  - **Electric Violet (#8A2BE2) to Cyan (#00FFFF) Gradients**: Represents the AI magic and the bridge between current state and future scale.
  - **Phosphorescent Green**: For success metrics and "system operational" indicators.
  - *Reasoning*: Captures the excitement of "next-gen" tech. It appeals to founders who want their product to feel cutting-edge and high-value.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Z-Pattern Flow**: Guiding the eye dynamically across the screen.
  - **Floating Cards**: Content sits on semi-transparent "glass" layers floating above a dynamic background.
  - **Centralized Focus**: Hero section focuses on a glowing, central visual (e.g., a code hologram).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glass Cards**: White opacity (5-10%) with background blur (backdrop-filter) and subtle white borders.
  - **Glow Effects**: Soft colored shadows behind key elements (buttons, hero image).
  - **Mesh Gradients**: Animated, slow-moving background gradients.
  - **3D Abstract Shapes**: Floating geometric primitives (cubes, spheres) representing code modules.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluidity**: Hover effects are smooth and elastic.
  - **Parallax**: Background elements move at different speeds than foreground content.
  - **Spotlight Borders**: Borders that light up as the mouse moves over them.

  **Animation**:
  - **Smooth Fade-ins**: Elements drift into place with ease-out curves.
  - **Continuous Motion**: Subtle pulsing or rotation in background elements so the page never feels dead.
  - **Shimmer**: Loading states and buttons have a light shimmer effect passing through them.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Sora** or **Outfit** (Modern, geometric sans-serifs).
  - **Body**: **DM Sans** (Clean, highly readable).
  - **Hierarchy**: distinct weights, using color gradients on key text to highlight value props.

  **Design Movement**: **Editorial Minimalist / "The New Standard"**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Clarity above all**: The problem is chaos (no-code spaghetti); the solution is clarity. The design must be a breath of fresh air.
  2.  **Trust & Authority**: Looks like a well-established consultancy or a Tier-1 VC firm.
  3.  **Human-Centric**: Focus on the founder's relief and success, not just the code.
  4.  **Sophisticated Restraint**: Luxury through absence of clutter.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Paper White (#FAFAFA)** or **Warm Beige (#F5F5F0)**: A soft, natural background.
  - **Charcoal (#1A1A1A)**: For text, softer than pure black.
  - **Deep Forest Green (#1B4D3E)** or **Navy (#0A2540)**: Represents stability, growth, and money.
  - **Muted Gold/Bronze**: For accents and high-value highlights.
  - *Reasoning*: Moves away from the "techy" look to a "business success" look. It says "We are the adults in the room."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Single Column Focus**: Narrower content columns for maximum readability (editorial style).
  - **Generous Whitespace**: Massive margins and padding. 
  - **Magazine Layouts**: Images and text overlapping slightly in interesting, artistic ways.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Serif Headings**: Using a sharp, modern serif for headlines to convey authority.
  - **High-Quality Photography**: Real photos of people working/collaborating, or abstract architectural photography (metaphor for building).
  - **Thin Lines**: Hairline dividers (1px) in soft gray.
  - **Solid Buttons**: Pill-shaped buttons with subtle drop shadows.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Subtle & Refined**: Micro-interactions are barely noticeable but add polish.
  - **Smooth Scrolling**: A heavy, luxurious scroll feel.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow Rise**: Content slowly rises and fades in.
  - **Image Reveals**: Images might unmask or scale down slightly upon viewing.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Playfair Display** or **Fraunces** (Modern Serif).
  - **Body**: **Inter** or **Satoshi** (Clean Sans-serif).
  - **Hierarchy**: driven by font style contrast (Serif vs Sans) rather than just size.
